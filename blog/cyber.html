                <p>The effect that the internet has had on the world is nothing short of breathtaking. It has in a very real sense, changed the way we interact, socialise, think in our generation and for generations to come. But it is also <em>breath-taking</em>. We collectively gasp and hold our breath as we are immersed in a virtual world without limits, but also without consequences. The internet to me is a two headed being; on one side the internet provides the ability for individuals to find communities and to share stories, to debate, to learn, to protest, to exist in a completely authentic way that is unprecedented in modern history (and without significant moderation from larger bodies). But this promising side can be eclipsed by another ugliness that invariably reveals itself: hatred, ignorance and violence.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Mostly little hateful internet trolls float restlessly across networks, bothering other users but otherwise causing little harm. Sometimes though, these users continually harrass other users, and even loosely group together to create a common sort of sad task force, like Gamergate. Despite the trauma and actual harm these groups of people may cause, little is being done to tackle harassment occurring over the internet. It seems being free of the shackles of the physical realm means also being beyond the reach of accountability or justice. (Now read that in Ned Starks voice)</p>
                <br>
                <p>As a young-ish person, the most common thing I will hear from peers about crazy or even horrifying things happening online is "that's just what the internet is about" along with "people are fucked" and a resigned, uninterested shrug. This acceptance kind of makes sense, as according to just about everyone the internet is super, super important to us. So why would we change it? An opinion survey performed by the Atlantic found that 59% of young people believe the internet shaped who they are (above religion or family values), where a UK survey unsurprisingly found that teenagers between the ages 16 - 24 spend around 27 hours per week online (more than a whole day!). Conservative media absolutely frothed over a recent survey conducted by Huff Post, in which young people rated 'internet connection' above 'hot water' and even 'daylight'.
                    <br><br>
                ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
                <br>
                <br>
                (ugh I can almost hear the oldies smugly announcing that computers and mobiles are bad did you know!!, as though ohmygod I literally never thought of that before thanks mum!!)</p>
                <br>
                <p>More than this, the internet is a source of income, many jobs almost exclusively operating online. As person with any influence or voice in the community, you almost definitely need an online presence as an extension of you. Even if your job has nothing to do with the internet, the image you project online affects your business and professional identity. If you ran a medical practice for example, your public image is affected by reviews (good or bad) and any media that may arise from your activities. This translates to community engagement and interest, and ultimately your bottom line income. Negative media like bad reviews or even negative news stories would undoubtably impact you even more. Any person can literally ruin their professional identity in one stroke thanks to the internet.</p>
                <br>
                <p>But what if someone wants to ruin your life? Using the internet it becomes possible. With the added cloak of anonymity, you don't even need to face this person or put your own public reputation on the line to ruin someone elses. Cyberbullying and cyberharassment** in the western world is on the increase over the years. Evidence of cyber harassment increasing: What makes cyberharassment different to "real life" harassment is important. While not as direct as being threatened or verbally assaulted in real life, harassment via the internet can have much longer lasting effects. The UN recently released a report suggesting that cyber violence is equivalent to physical violence in women. This is because the ability to return to images, words or experiences of harassment online over and over again essentially retraumatises the victim, deepening its psychological effects. Remembering a negative or scary experience in your memory is not the same as revisiting the negative experience on an online space, where you also might have little to no control over how it is shared and consumed. This is the particularly insidious nature of online harassment, trolling or violence.</p>
                <br>
                <p>While taking a break from social media is a good thing and also definitely good for you (and applauded by people like me who spend an ungodly amount of time punishing ourselves scrolling instagram feeds), it seems like this is often our only answer to online harassment. "Why don't you just get off the internet?" "Why don't you just shut down your account?" And given the ubiquitousness of the internet in our daily lives and livelihood, it seems a mile short of how we should be managing it. In the context of gendered violence, the 'why don't you just get off the internet so you won't be harassed' sounds sadly similar to other ways that responsibility is subtly placed on victims to manage violence. ('If you don't want to be assaulted at the club, maybe just don't go?') At these moments it can feel like the internet is just another place that women aren't welcome. Besides this, removing yourself from the internet doesn't stop the harassment itself. If your name is continuously slandered online, this can still affect you in your career, community, social circles and your reputation.</p>
                <br>
                <p>There are several reasons cyberviolence remains an issue. There is little law supporting criminal penalties for online abuse, and what we do have in most countries is largely inadequate. On top of this, law enforcements often do not have the technical ability to address or chase up issues that arise online. They sometimes have no idea about social media and how it works (in a landmark case in America, a judge famously asked "what is facebook"). In some of the worst cases of cyberharassment, victims have been told by police to just remove themselves from the internet, or even worse, to simply confront their harasser in real life. Its clear that police often do not appreciate the scope of the internet on the livelihood and wellbeing of people, or otherwise feel that there are no tools at their disposal to do anything about it. Finally, possibly in the light of all this, victims rarely report cyber based crime. Citizens of the digital world are mostly unaware of their rights as there is no clea</p>
                <br>
                <p>As the online world powers ahead, rapidly morphing to address our evolving desire for interaction, information and rehashing of Mariah Carey's top 10 shadiest moments, it appears our legal framework to protect digital citizens is lagging behind. The free speech versus hate speech debate is taking place globally, and there is perhaps a hesitation to criminalise what can be considered discourse or individual opinion, a slippery slope indeed. But if you wouldn't threaten a person in real life, why is it ok to do online? As people of different sexualities, colours and genders are increasingly at the receiving end of serious, vile and continuous threats online, why are we not pushing harder to hold the perpetrators of these actions accountable?</p>
