            <h1>Thank You Come Again: the 'Apu Problem'</h1>
            <p>Earlier this week the creators of the Simpsons announced the removal of ApuÂ Nahasapeemapetilon from the award-winning and long spanning show. This comes on the tails of growing pushback and controversy about the character being a offensive and one sided stereotype of Indian-Americans, furthered by the release of a documentary 'The problem with Apu' by Hari Kondabolu in 2017.</p>
            <p>What's surprising is a comedy giant such as Matt Groening failing to even consider the perspective of South Asians on the Apu stereotype, who has in recent years alluded to this idea of "entitled milennials" and "policitical incorrectness" in several Simpsons episodes. With Apu, the creators response has been either completely absent, or in recent times, a short blunt response in one episode in which the issue "may come up at a later date""If at all". The Simpsons have a long history of criticising and questioning american culture, so after becoming such a cornerstone of culture itself, it seems more than a little disappointing that the show sees itself as above criticism, or that this is an issue of "political correctness gone wrong" or SJWs being oversensitive. It seems like a sign of The Simpsons losing touch with a changing culture, where as more diverse members of Western society gain influence, the push for better representation becomes a more central issue to western media.</p>
            <p>Oddly, Apu was the first representation of an Indian-American on television, despite the fact that he is not a real person. This in itself is a landmark moment for TV that The Simpsons were applauded for at the time. Apu himself is not actually a bad character; he is hardworking, endlessly optimistic and committed to his values and beliefs. But as Kondabolu points out, Apu is a "fossil of his time" with little to no character development in the span of the almost 30 years of the show running. The population of South Asians in the USA has tripled in this time, which begs to question why the growth of South Asians on screen has not seen a similar boom.</p>
